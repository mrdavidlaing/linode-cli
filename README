Currently, only the DNS module is in-place, and it is display only.

Usage examples:

 - Show all A DNS records for example.com:

        ./linode-cli.rb dns show a example.com

 - Show all DNS records for example.com:

        ./linode-cli.rb dns show example.com

 - Show all CNAME DNS records for all accessible domains:

        ./linode-cli.rb dns show cname

 - Show all DNS records for all accessible domains:

        ./linode-cli.rb dns show

Put a symlink in your ~/bin directory named 'linode' for super-easy access!
    ln -s path/to/linode-cli.rb ~/bin/linode

Everything's in one file for ease of use as a script for now, but I plan to bundle it into a gem for proper packaging at some point.
